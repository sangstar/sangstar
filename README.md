### Hi there 👋

My name is Sanger Steel. I'm a machine learning engineer. I'm currently working on adding new projects to here, as I've been spending a lot of time writing ML articles on my [website](https://sangstar.github.io/). Some projects I do have are pinned.

Currently open for work. Please contact me at sangersteel@gmail.com
